## ANALYSIS FOR MICROSOFT'S SUCCESS ON NEW MOVIE STUDIO

**Author: Trixie Cherop

### Business Problem

Big companies have been creating original movie content and Microsoft also wishes to give it a try. They don’t know much about movie creation and therefore we are charged with the responsibility of finding out what films are doing well at the box office. We are expected to translate our findings into actionable insights that will help them as them as they begin their journey.


## Project Overview
Microsoft seeks to venture into movie production in the fast growing entertainment industry. However, they don’t know anything about movie creation. This project is an attempt to help Microsoft understand the dynamics of movie industry and what does well at the box office. 
The objectives of our study were to identify most popular movie based on rating, what type of films do well in the domestic market, to identify what type of films do well in the foreign market , to analyse the effect of rating on revenue and to analyse the effect runtime on movie success. The analysis uses data from IMDB.We first cleaned our data to remove or replace missing information before exploring the contents in details. The descriptive analysis used plenty of visualization to give understanding of the trends.From the analysis, we found out that Adventure is the highly rated genre, meaning it is the most liked in both domestic and foreign market.Sci-Fi has the highest revenue in the domestic market .A film with (Adventure, Drama, Sport) does well in the foreign market since it had the highest revenue. Rating has close to no effect on revenue(both domestic and foreign) since there was a weak correlation between them. Measuring success in terms of revenue, runtime has close to no effect on movie success since the correlation between them was also weak. The recommendations from our analysis were:For the domestic audience Microsoft can more on producing Sci-Fi since that is what yields the highest revenue in the domestic market. For the foreign audience, Microsoft can focus on producing a film with a genre combination of Adventure, Drama and Sport since that is what yields the highest revenue in the foreign market. Based on what is most liked by the two markets Microsoft can produce more Adventure themed films. Runtime has little impact on success in terms of revenue, hence there is flexibility of choosing the length of the filmns. They can focus on a compelling story regardless of the runtime. .


### The Data

In the folder `IMDB Data' are movie datasets from:
* [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/) We used the titles, ratings and revenue data sets for analysis.

### Methods
This project uses descriptive analysis and a lot of visualizations such as bar graphs, histograms and heatmaps.These give an overview of the popular movie genres and what genres fetch the highest revenue.

### Results
Based on our analysis, Sci-Fi has the highest revenue in the domestic market .A film with (Adventure, Drama, Sport) does well in the foreign market since it had the highest revenue. Adventure is the highly rated genre, meaning it is the most liked in both domestic and foreign market. Rating has close to no effect on revenue(both domestic and foreign) since there was a weak correlation between them. Measuring success in terms of revenue, runtime has close to no effect on movie success since the correlation between them was weak.

### Conclusion
The analysis resulted in the following recommendation:
**For the domestic audience :** Focus more on producing Sci-Fi since that is what yields the highest revenue in the domestic market.
**For the foreign audience :** Focus more on producing a film with the genre combination of Adventure, Drama and Sport since that is what yields the highest revenue in the foreign market.
**Based on what is most liked by the two markets:** Focus on producing more Adventure themed films.
**Runtime has little impact on success in terms of revenue:** You are therefore have the flexibility of choosing the length of your filmns. You can focus on compelling story regardless of runtime
